# Good Docker Resources

This is a list of good Docker resources I found on web. Most of these are discovered using Docker weekly newsletters.

1. ​:memo: [ENTRYPOINT vs CMD: Back to Basics](http://www.johnzaccone.io/entrypoint-vs-cmd-back-to-basics/): A good blog that explains difference between two common Dockerfile commands. An in-depth to the point post. 
2. ​:memo: [Linux Docker base images](https://sreeninet.wordpress.com/2017/05/13/linux-docker-base-images/): This blogs talks about how you can create your own linux base images using `mkimage.sh` file.
